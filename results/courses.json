            "credits": "4 ",
            "description": "The course introduces fundamentals of probability for data science. Students survey data visualization methods and summary statistics, develop models for data, and apply statistical techniques to assess the validity of the models. The techniques will include parametric and nonparametric methods for parameter estimation and hypothesis testing for a single sample mean and two sample means, for proportions, and for simple linear regression. Students will acquire sound theoretical footing for the methods where practical, and will apply them to real-world data, primarily using R."

            "description": "Implementing the networking code for multiplayer games is a complex task that requires an understanding of performance, security, game design, and advanced programming concepts. In this course, students are introduced to the networking stack and how this is connected to the Internet, learn how to write protocols for games, and implement several large games using a game engine that demonstrate the kind of networking and protocols required by different genres of games. In addition, tools are introduced that help understand and debug networking code, simplify the creation of protocols, and make the development of networking code easier."
